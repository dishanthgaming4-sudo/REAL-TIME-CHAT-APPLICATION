DESCRIPTION: The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a web-based project designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly platform for testing knowledge through multiple-choice questions. This application allows users to view questions one at a time, select answers, receive instant visual feedback for correct and incorrect choices, and track their final score at the end of the quiz. The system dynamically loads questions and answer options, ensuring smooth navigation between questions using a “Next” button. It also highlights the correct answer after each selection and disables further input to prevent changes, making the quiz experience clear and fair. The application features a clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface that enhances usability and accessibility across different screen sizes. This project is developed using **HTML** for structuring the content, **CSS** for styling and layout design, and **JavaScript** for handling application logic, dynamic question rendering, event handling, score calculation, and user interaction. By integrating these core web technologies, the application demonstrates strong fundamentals in front-end development, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI design. Overall, this project showcases practical skills in building interactive web applications, problem-solving, and creating an intuitive user experience, making it highly suitable for an internship portfolio.
